-----------------------
Compile mountainlab and add the following to your path

mountainlab/mountainprocess/bin
mountainlab/mountainview/bin
mountainlab/mdaconvert/bin

(Torben, I can show you how to use mdaconvert to conveniently convert your raw data into .mda)

----------------------
Place the raw data in this directory: tetrode8.mda

-----------------------
Run the sorting:
> run_sorting.sh

See alg_scda_004.js and params.par

-----------------------
View the results
> view_results.sh

This opens mountainview
